  ## Description:
  My motivation for creating this project was to make a notetaker app applying both the front and back end. This solves the problem of running an api from the backend. In learning this process I was able to get, post and delete responses. Also creating routes that the app can go to directly. In the end I used Heroku as a cloud platform to create this app.

  This can be further expanded upon by making more routes that the site can go to. Of course would need to be cloned on github in order to make additions.
